# Bookstore App

## Description
This is the README.md file for the bookstore project, as part of
AlbanyCanCode's JavaScript Frameworks class.

Here, you can organize books into three different categories:
* Currently Reading
* Want to Read
* Read

You can organize these books through the dropdown menus for each book.

You can also search for available books through the search function on this app.
When you do, you can follow the same procedure when you want to put a book into a category.
